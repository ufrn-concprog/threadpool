# Using thread pools in Java #

## About
This repository contains an example to demonstrate the use of a thread pool in the Java programming language with the [`Executor`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html) framework. This concurrency facility allows reusing threads relying on the creation of a pool with a fixed number of threads that execute the same single task, instead of creating new threads.
